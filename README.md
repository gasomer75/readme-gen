## Description

- This application was designed to simplify creating ReadMe files by using a command line interface where question prompts allow user input into fields that generally appear in a professional ReadMe.md file. The input is collected and then used to complete the template and generate a ReadMe file.
- The template used contains the main sections that are typically included in a ReadMe file. It's basic design is what makes it simple and appealing. However, there may be sections that a user wishes to include in their ReadMe file that are not part of this template.
